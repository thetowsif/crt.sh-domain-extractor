# subdomain-extractor
This simple Python script will open a local web port on `127.0.0.1:8001` You can use this tool to gather subdomains from [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) easily. For example, if you have a large, unsorted list of domains/subdomains on a webpage, you can copy the entire webpage and extract only the domains/subdomains graphically with this tool.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
